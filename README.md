sessions-and-storing-data

An express.js application which used middleware functions to perform session management. The other movie application enabled the usage of a non-relational database for data storage. 

Project helped improve my knowledge of forming own middleware to parse cookies/creating an in-memory session store as well as integrating mongodb with an Express web application using Mongoose.
